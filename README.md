# CS2308_redo_PA1
This repository is meant to hold files regarding the re-completion of programming assignments from Jill Seaman's Spring CS 2308 course: Foundations of Computer Science II
[instructions_PA1.pdf](https://github.com/johnsonzech/CS2308_redo_PA1/files/6964204/instructions_PA1.pdf)





Attached to this readme should be the instructions for programming assignment #1 *Note*
/* 
*Note* Some particular instructions may be amended/ignored as the point of re-completing these assignments
is to apply knowledge I have learned since originally completing the course, as well as to evaluate
the efficiency and efficacy of my problem-solving methods. If there is no note of any amendments to the 
original instructions, it is assumed that the original instructions will be followed as closely as possible.

******* AMENDMENTS TO ORIGINAL PA #1 INSTRUCTIONS ********

1. Sample output file output1.txt is unavailable -- make output table easily readable
2. If more than one part shares the maximum quantity, output all part names that share the maximum quantity.
